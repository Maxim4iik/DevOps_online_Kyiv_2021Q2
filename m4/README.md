When performing the first task, simple networks were built of the type of hub-computers, hub-hub, switch-switch and switch-router-switch 

Performing the second task, a complex scheme of the corporate network was modeled

Performing the third task, a network was built from a segment (5 computers and a server) and a server connected to the router. 
Routing was done using the Rip protocol

# DevOps_online_Kyiv_2021Q2
During 8'th task we've done a lot of different things. 
At first we installed Jenkins on our platform and using ssh-client(Termius) we copy-pasted all commands from first presentation
Then we unlocked Jenkins, configurated it and made first simple job exmaple
Discovered how to make CI-Cd via Jenkins itself and AWS
And in the end we discovered how to use Jenkins Node(Slaves)
